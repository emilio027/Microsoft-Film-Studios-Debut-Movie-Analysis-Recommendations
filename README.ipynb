    "# Business Problem\n",
    "Analyzing the monetary data from movies of the last century and adjusting all monetary figures to account for inflation is how we give Microsoft a realistic expecations of the amount of money needed to make a blockbuster hit and how much money they could expect in return. We will be looking at what genre movies is the most profitable, how much Microsoft should expect the movie to cost and how much they can expect to make back. \n",

    "\n",
    "We first analyzed the movie_budgets.csv file to acquire an understanding of the financials of all the movies for the last 100 years. After that, all monetary values were adjusted for inflation to get a better understanding of the real financial commiment Microsoft will have to take if they are to produce a blockbuster debut film. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was then sorted by return on investment and modified to relefect only movies with budgets over 15 million USD. This was done to show the top 100 most profitable movies with the exception of low-budget films as cult classics are usually outliers in the indie film industry and their return on investment is disproportionate to other films. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data from title_basics.csv was then used to asign a genre to each of the top movies. Once the dataframes refelcted the genre data we examined the frequency of the each genre and complied a list of the top four most popular genres from the most profitable studio-budget films of the last one hundred years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly the we examined each genre individually to acquire a mean for the total movie budgets and the expected return on investment. "
